# Raymond's Personal Website

My personal website for showing projects, blog post, and photo journals.

## Tech-stack

This website is currently hosted as a static website.

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend 'framework' for this website! The project was initialised using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Superset of CSS (adds extra useful features).

## Dev Tools

- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) - Enforce 'good' JavaScript practices & consistent code style.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Similar to Eslint.

## Running the Code

If you want to play around with the website and make changes in the code, you can:

1. Download the code locally

   `git clone git@github.com:Raymond-Su/personal-website.git`

2. Navigate to the directory

   `cd personal-website`

3. Install packages and dependencies locally

   `npm install`

4. Run a live server under a development environment

   `npm start`

The website should be live and accessible at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
